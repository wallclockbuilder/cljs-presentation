Basic ClojureScript via a hands-on approach in Light Table

##Basic
Open Light Table.
To begin, open the command pane (type Control-SPACE), Add Connection, select Light Table UI. Once connected you can evaluate all the forms in this file by placing the cursor after the form and typing Command-ENTER.

IMPORTANT: You must evaluate the very first form, the namespace definition.
